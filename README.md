# Starbucks-Sales-Product-Analysis-
🚀 I'm excited to share my latest project – Starbucks Sales & Product Analysis using MS SQL Server and Power BI! ☕📊

In this project, I worked on a simulated dataset of Starbucks product and sales information. I began by writing complex SQL queries in MS SQL Server to analyze key performance metrics such as:

✅ Total transactions and quantity sold
✅ Revenue by product type and store location
✅ Monthly sales trends and time-based buying behavior
✅ High-performing and underperforming products
✅ Product contribution to category revenue using window functions
✅ Insights on payment modes and product categories

Once the data was cleaned and structured, I visualized it using Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard showcases:

📍 Revenue distribution by product type
📍 Store performance mapped geographically
📍 Product categories and payment mode breakdown
📍 Time-based revenue and quantity analytics
📍 KPI cards showing totals, revenue, and transactions

✨ This project helped me strengthen my SQL skills, gain hands-on experience with Power BI, and understand how data can drive real business decisions. I'm very proud of the insights uncovered and happy to share it with my network!

🛠️ Tools Used: MS SQL Server, Power BI
📈 Skills Applied: Data Analysis, Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, Grouping, CASE Statements, Dashboard Design

Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions!
